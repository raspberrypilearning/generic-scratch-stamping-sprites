In Scratch you can use `stamp`{:class="blockpen"} to draw a copy of a sprite's costume on the stage. 

Try clicking the `stamp`{:class="blockpen"} in the palette...

...to create a copy of your sprite's costume. Drag your sprite to see the copy.

Here's an example that creates a row of stamps and then hides the actual sprite:

You could use it to create a repeating background like this forest of trees:

You can't move or change the stamps with code. You can use `clear`{:class="blockpen"} to remove them.
